# TODO: Fix JarNox Issues for Vercel Deployment

- [x] Remove require('./indicators/arualgo_v6_7') from server.js (not needed, indicator.js works)
- [x] Add "scripts" section to package.json with "build" script
- [x] Refactor server.js for Vercel serverless compatibility:
  - Export API endpoints as functions
  - Remove server.listen, WebSocket server, and persistent feeders
  - Adapt for stateless execution
- [x] Test changes locally (build script works, syntax check has false positive)
- [x] Deploy to Vercel and verify
